0. ================================================ Things to know before you start
- this spec is not final, it's just a guide
- anything that you think is wrong should get corrected
- all communication between nodes is asynchronous
- meaning of constants:
  - N - number of nodes
  - K - length of side of world
  - G - number of generations

1. ================================================ Data format
cell_t {
  int x,y;			//position of cell in the world
  cell_habitant_t type;		//what is living inside
  int starvation, breeding;	//properties of living creature
}

2. ================================================ Master/Servant
Nodes will be split in 2 groups:
- master (1 node) - will be handling communication, synchronisation, propagation and evenly divide the work between servants
- servant (N-1 nodes) - will be doing all computation and logic
Implementation: http://dvbmonkey.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/an-open-mpi-master-servant-example/

3. ================================================ Messages types
- NEW_BOARD(side:int)
- UPDATE_CELL(c : cell_t)
- FINISHED()
- START_NEXT_GENERATION(RED or BLACK)

4. ================================================ Master
Data:
- array of all cells
- size of board
Algorithm:
- loads world from file
- splits the world in N-1 parts
- sends NEW_BOARD(K) to every node
- sends correct part of board to every node + 1 cell border around it by sending UPDATE_CELL messages (now the nodes have data to work on)
- sends FINISHED to confirm sending all cells
- in 2*G step loop:
  - sends START_NEXT_GENERATION(color) to every node
  - starts listening on all channels for incoming updates, saves them
  - counts FINISHED messages - if count == N-1 then sub-gen finished
  - sends stored updates to all servants
  - sends FINISHED to all servants
- sends FINISHED to all servants to notify that all generations are finished
- starts to listen for UPDATE_CELL from all servants, save incoming cell into a world array
- counts incoming FINISHED messages - if N-1 the comutation is finished
- prints the output to stdout
- exits

5. ================================================ Servant
Data:
- array of ~(1/N) cells 
- startX, endX, startY, endY - position of board piece
Algorythm:
- starts listening for NEW_BOARD message -> allocates memory for its board part
- listens for UPDATE_CELL messages, saves messages to board
- listens for FINISHED meaning all cells are in place
- in loop:
  - listens for message
    - if it is FINISHED - all generations are finished - break the loop
    - if START_NEXT_GENERATION(color) - start next generation of color 'color'
  - do the computation of its part of the board
  - send cells there were changed on a border to master with message UPDATE_CELL
  - when done sends FINISHED to master
  - listens for UPDATE_CELL messages from master
  - if cells are in its part of the board updates them (potentially resolves conflicts)
  - listens for FINISHED message from master
- sends all cells from board to master with UPDATE_CELL
- exits
